### Text entropy (Excercise 1.)

Script entropia.py calculates entropy (characters or words) of text from a given file. Conditional entropy can also be calculated.

## Usage

`python entropia.py -f <file_name> -t <C|W> -n <level>`

`file_name` - Name of text file to be analyzed.

`C` - Entropy of characters from text. `W` - Entropy of words from text.

`level` - Level of conditional entropy (e.g. level 2 takes 2 words before analyzed word into the condition).
